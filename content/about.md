# A bit about me

Hello! I'm James!

If you're on this page you probably know me in real life or you know someone who does! If you don't [drop me a line][1]! Would love to hear how you found this website! Ever since I was a child I've enjoyed building and creating stuff. The pile of lego blocks and my parents' testimony with confirm that! So I decided to collate everything that I have done (and will do) on this website!

## A bit...more about me

I'm...27...hope that's still acurrate, if only there was someway to auto upda, nevermind! I grew up on the Isle of Man and currently still live there!
