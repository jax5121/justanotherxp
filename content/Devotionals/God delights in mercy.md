I don't have to know you to know you've struggled. We've all got that something in our lives that we know we shouldn't do...but we do anyway. I don't know what that is in your life but the important thing is, you know! It's the thing that comes to mind when you here the word **sin**, that habit or behaviour that you have been desparate to change but have been unable to. No matter how hard you pray, it just doesn't seem to stick. It can be hard to hear about God's mercy when you've indulged these particular habits. You feel like you don't deserve the grace that Jesus hands out freely. 

I remember looking for examples of gentleness in the bible and I was brought to the story of Jesus, the pharisees and the woman caught in adultry ([John 8:1-11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A1-11&version=NIV)). This is story I'd heard countless times, Jesus saves the woman from the Pharisees and they're sent away in disgrace and the woman is given a second chance. Lovely right? 

As I was reading this again verse 7 stood out to be in 2 ways. Firstly (what I'd always read), Jesus is asking the Pharisees if they are "*without sin*" and are worthy to be put in judgement over this woman. Secondly, from what we know and go on to read later in the bible he is saying, "Only I have the right to throw a stone!". There are many passages that describe God as a judge who despises sin. There are many images of the bible of what will happen to those who don't turn from their sinful ways. When all the Pharisees had accepted they'd been beaten and left, the woman and Jesus were left alone. The woman, no doubt, was terrified. While the circumstances of how she got their had been questionable, she had been caught in adultry. Sure the Pharisees had been expertly dismissed with one sentence (v7) but before her stood the man who claims that he has the right to condemn her! 

Jesus turned and said *"...neither do I condemn you,...go now and leave your life of sin"* (v11 NIV) What an inimitable act of gentleness and grace. Later on in Matthew, Jesus would go on to say *"But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' "For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.""*. Jesus wants to be merciful! His death for us was an action rooted in love for us and the desire to see us secured in him rather than lost! There are so many passages in the bible that describe God's yearning to show mercy to us rather than judgement.

- "A bruised reed he will not break" [Isaiah 42:3]()
- "I will heal their backsliding. I will love them freely, for my anger has turned away from him." Hosea 14:4
- "I am slow to anger and filled with unending faithfulness and love" Exodus 34:6
- "He doesn't retain his anger forever, because he delights in mercy. He will have compassion on us...(He) will cast all our sins into the depth of the sea" Micah 7:18-19
- The father's reaction to the prodigal son when he returns home Luke 15:20-22

If we return to him, God will always welcome us home again! God would rather that we fail and come back to him repeatedly than to give up and go on without him. Each time we come back we learn the mercies of God are new every day ([Lamentations 3:22-23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lamentations+3%3A22-23&version=ESV)).

Notice though that in this story Jesus doesn't pronounce forgiveness...there will be concequences of the woman's sin that will play out and that is the cost of sin. But Jesus, every time, extends the invitation to leave the life of sin and to walk with him.

There may be days where you find yourself asking "Why isn't God throwing the stone at me, I deserve it!". You're right, but the truth is, God doesn't want to. He wants to show you mercy!
