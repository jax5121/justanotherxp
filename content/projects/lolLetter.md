When I was in university I was intoduced to the game Love Letter. A very simple game that can be played with up to 4 people. Each player is vying for the princess' affections and they must use their influences to remove the competition.

It was something quick and easy we could play to pass the time between classes (although I wasn't necessarily very good at it). During the COVID-19, the vast majority of people were trapped in their homes with not a lot to do...Thankfully video game designers have been preparing for a moment like this and Berserk Games have created a game [Table Top Simulator](https://www.tabletopsimulator.com/) which allows you to digitally play all those board games with others in the comfort of your own home.

This game also allows you to create and share your own games so, one evening, I scanned my copy of Love Letter, set up a custom game type and invited some of my friends to play it! I thought about inviting more friends in but to do that I would need the premium edition of Love Letter...which is much harder to find.

So instead of buying the premium edition, I made my own! My friends and I all play the game [League of Legends]("https://euw.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/") which contains a massive host of characters. So I thought I'll take some and use them as cards.

I gathered together a few of my friends and we listed characters that we thought would fit into the roles of the game. After that I created a template in photoshop and, using character splash arts from the game (I'm not THAT good at drawing!), I put together a complete set of cards that matched the expanded version of the original game.
