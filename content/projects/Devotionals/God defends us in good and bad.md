Do you ever feel, like a plastic bag, drifting through the wind (Katy Perry stops here I promise!). Seriously though do you sometimes feel like you go through periods of life where you feel like your being buffetted by life and your circumstances appear completely out of your control (rather akin to a plastic bag in the wind). There are many people in the bible that suffered in this way but one of them was Job and he had a really hard time. Job was set upon by the Satan, he lost everything he had, including his children ([1:13-19][1]) and his health was badly affected ([2:7][2]). Job was devestated! Yet still held fast to the Lord and his integrity. He believed God was in control of the situation albeit unsure as to why any of it happened. 

God is in control of the good and the bad. Don't believe me? Check this out! God is in control of the Satan! In both situations God placed limitations on what the Satan could do to Job! In the first God said "on the man himself you will not lay a finger." ([1:12][3]),the Satan obeyed and in the second God said "you must spare his life." ([2:6][4]) and the Satan obeyed! God held Job throughout the ordeal he was going through and continues to hold him through his grief. He's holding you too! He will not allow your current situation to get to you as long as you trust that he won't. Trust him to pull you through, think back to other times where he has pulled you through and thank him for those times! The Satan will come and go, but God will always be there.
